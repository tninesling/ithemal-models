# Ithemal models

[Ithemal](https://github.com/ithemal/Ithemal) models trained on different datasets, using various versions of the tool.
The latest models are in the [bhive](bhive/) subdirectory, trained using the [BHive dataset](https://github.com/ithemal/bhive).
The models used in the [Ithemal paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07412) are in the [paper](paper/) subdirectory.
To use these models, check out the [Prediction section in the Ithemal README](https://github.com/ithemal/Ithemal#prediction).

## 2025 Update

The original RNN models from the paper as well as new model architectures are in the [update-2025](update-2025/) directory. These models are also trained on the [BHive dataset](https://github.com/ithemal/bhive).
